# [Warp 2023](https://threlte.xyz/hackathon) hackathon submission

- _Title_: roomba time!
- _Track_: Wow!
- _Short Description_: roomba time! is an interactive experience where you are a roomba and clean up debris and dust. I was thinking about WALL-E and how existential that movie is. Ideally, I would support sockets for multiplauer but I ran out of time.
